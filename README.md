<h2>This repo is Forked from eladkarako with the intention of updating and creating additional functions</h2> 

This Android kitchen gave me a spark of interest in coding and development of Android and OpenSource software. I have modded many ROMs with over a couple years of use
and want to contribute as much as I can to the original or possibly use this as inspiration for future projects.

<h3>The following was written by the original repo creator</h3>

I've UnUPX (unpacked the UPX compression) most of the files, but that's it, other than that it's the latest (semi-)unmodified version of v1.82.
<br/>
Note: I would recommend you'll use a newer better "kitchen" such as SuperR's free version: https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/linux-free-superrs-kitchen-v1-2-1-2-7-24-20.3597434/ .
Although you'll need to use a virtual-machine and linux for the free version (the donated version have a Windows variation),  
editing the content of many files (boot.img internal-storage, extracting files from a sparse img by mounting or even just proper text-based files such as build.prop) requires proper root-permission system or a proper linux-EOL shell some the end result wouldn't f\*\*\*ed-up your device, and - no - Cygwin is not an alternative, and yes - it took me a while to figure it out!

Anyway, you can easily download the whole thing using: https://github.com/eladkarako/ASSAYYED_KITCHEN/archive/master.zip
